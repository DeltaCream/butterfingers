added lib.rs

Currently, nothing has changed for main.rs, and thus the program should not break. However, just in case that lib.rs will be used, the code is already prepared.

1. ordered functions (that are currently commented) in invoke_handler in order of appearance in lib.rs
2. the ordering of the modules in lib.rs are the following:
a. utils (miscellaneous stuff and functions used in other modules)
b. manage (viewing enrolled employees, deleting and verifying fingerprints)
c. enroll (enrollment)
d. attendance (for attendance-taking functions and identify)

TODO:
A. Experiment with making lib.rs work together with main.rs (should the need arises)
B. Experiment with access modifiers for non-tauri command functions (see which functions do not need the pub access modifier)
